        Don't be bitchin' honey 'Cos you're holding all the money, And new we're outlaws, r un nrng scared, And I don't think it's funny, Keep your foot on the gas now baby, Don't you let 'em in, 'Cos we just thieves and I don't need, To be back on that chain again. Don't you be complaining, 'Cos you're gonna do my brain in, We just trying to cop a teel, And I think the cops are gaining, Got that peda i to the metal baby, Don't you let 'em win, 'Cos we just thieves, and I don't need, To be back on that chain again. (First chorus) Don't shoot me down, I ain't no violent man, Don't put a.ay in my hand, I ain't gonna do no time, I know I've been a fool. But please don't send me down, I don't want to spend my life locked up, Without no women around. Now we're back on the street, In love with every whore I meet, 'Cos money walks and money talks, And I can hardly keep my feet, Iteen lookin'over your shoulder baby, In case they zero in, 'Cos we just thieves and I don't need, To be back on that chain again. (Third chorus) Police don t shoot me down, I don't want to die in the dust. I can't make the scene where I die like a dog with the crowd lookmg on m disgust, We're just kids with guns, American as apple pre rio don't you put that hurt on me. I ain't gonna do no time, We were just running scared. everybody but us knew the game We never had no reason to kill, But those people are dead just the same.        </>
