      paragrafs:[`Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition that affects people's behaviour. People with ADHD can seem restless, may have trouble concentrating and may act on impulse.

      Symptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age and may become more noticeable when a child's circumstances change, such as when they start school.
      
      Most cases are diagnosed when children are under 12 years old, but sometimes it's diagnosed later in childhood.
      
      Sometimes ADHD was not recognised when someone was a child, and they are diagnosed later as an adult.
      
      The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who were diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems.
      
      People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders.`,`Getting help
        Many children go through phases where they're restless or inattentive. This is often completely normal and does not necessarily mean they have ADHD.

        But you should discuss your concerns with your child's teacher, their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or a GP if you think their behaviour may be different from most children their age.

        It's also a good idea to speak to a GP if you're an adult and think you may have ADHD, but were not diagnosed with the condition as a child.`,`What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?
        The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but the condition has been shown to run in families.

        Research has also identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD when compared with those without the condition.

        Other factors suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include:

        being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy)
        having a low birthweight
        smoking or alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy
        ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it's more common in people with learning difficulties.`,`How attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is treated
        For children with ADHD, although there's no cure, it can be managed with appropriate educational support, advice and support for parents and affected children, alongside medicine, if necessary.

        For adults with ADHD, medicine is often the first treatment offered, although psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may also help.`,`Living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
        Parents of children with ADHD
        Looking after a child with ADHD can be challenging, but it's important to remember that they cannot help their behaviour.

        Some day-to-day activities might be more difficult for you and your child, including:

        getting your child to sleep at night
        getting ready for school on time
        listening to and carrying out instructions
        being organised
        social occasions

        Adults with ADHD
        Adults with ADHD may find they have problems with:

        focusing and completing tasks
        coping with stress
        feeling restless or impatient
        impulsiveness and risk taking

      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. People with ADHD experience an ongoing pattern of the following types of symptoms:
      
      Inattention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and these problems are not due to defiance or lack of comprehension.
      Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate, or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. In adults, hyperactivity may mean extreme restlessness or talking too much.
      Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsivity could also include a desire for immediate rewards or the inability to delay gratification. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences.`, `Signs and Symptoms
      Some people with ADHD mainly have symptoms of inattention. Others mostly have symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity. Some people have both types of symptoms.
      
      Many people experience some inattention, unfocused motor activity, and impulsivity, but for people with ADHD, these behaviors:
      
      Are more severe
      Occur more often
      Interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially, at school, or in a job`,`Inattention
      People with symptoms of inattention may often:
      
      Overlook or miss details and make seemingly careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activities
      Have difficulty sustaining attention during play or tasks, such as conversations, lectures, or lengthy reading
      Not seem to listen when spoken to directly
      Find it hard to follow through on instructions or finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace, or may start tasks but lose focus and get easily sidetracked
      Have difficulty organizing tasks and activities, doing tasks in sequence, keeping materials and belongings in order, managing time, and meeting deadlines
      Avoid tasks that require sustained mental effort, such as homework, or for teens and older adults, preparing reports, completing forms, or reviewing lengthy papers
      Lose things necessary for tasks or activities, such as school supplies, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, and cell phones
      Be easily distracted by unrelated thoughts or stimuli
      Be forgetful in daily activities, such as chores, errands, returning calls, and keeping appointments`],

        But you should discuss your concerns with your child's teacher, their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or a GP if you think their behaviour may be different from most children their age.

        It's also a good idea to speak to a GP if you're an adult and think you may have ADHD, but were not diagnosed with the condition as a child.`,`What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?
        The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but the condition has been shown to run in families.

        Research has also identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD when compared with those without the condition.

        Other factors suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include:

        being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy)
        having a low birthweight
        smoking or alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy
        ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it's more common in people with learning difficulties.`,`How attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is treated
        For children with ADHD, although there's no cure, it can be managed with appropriate educational support, advice and support for parents and affected children, alongside medicine, if necessary.

        For adults with ADHD, medicine is often the first treatment offered, although psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may also help.`,`Living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. People with ADHD experience an ongoing pattern of the following types of symptoms:
      
      Inattention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and these problems are not due to defiance or lack of comprehension.
      Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate, or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. In adults, hyperactivity may mean extreme restlessness or talking too much.
      Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsivity could also include a desire for immediate rewards or the inability to delay gratification. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences.`, `Signs and Symptoms
      Some people with ADHD mainly have symptoms of inattention. Others mostly have symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity. Some people have both types of symptoms.
      
      Many people experience some inattention, unfocused motor activity, and impulsivity, but for people with ADHD, these behaviors:
      
      Are more severe
      Occur more often
      Interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially, at school, or in a job`,`Inattention

      Have difficulty sustaining attention during play or tasks, such as conversations, lectures, or lengthy reading
      Not seem to listen when spoken to directly
      Find it hard to follow through on instructions or finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace, or may start tasks but lose focus and get easily sidetracked
      Have difficulty organizing tasks and activities, doing tasks in sequence, keeping materials and belongings in order, managing time, and meeting deadlines
      Avoid tasks that require sustained mental effort, such as homework, or for teens and older adults, preparing reports, completing forms, or reviewing lengthy papers
      Lose things necessary for tasks or activities, such as school supplies, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, and cell phones
      Be easily distracted by unrelated thoughts or stimuli

      paragrafs:[`Overview
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is marked by an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. People with ADHD experience an ongoing pattern of the following types of symptoms:
      
      Inattention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and these problems are not due to defiance or lack of comprehension.
      Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate, or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. In adults, hyperactivity may mean extreme restlessness or talking too much.
      Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsivity could also include a desire for immediate rewards or the inability to delay gratification. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences.`, `Signs and Symptoms
      Some people with ADHD mainly have symptoms of inattention. Others mostly have symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity. Some people have both types of symptoms.
      
      Many people experience some inattention, unfocused motor activity, and impulsivity, but for people with ADHD, these behaviors:
      
      Are more severe
      Occur more often
      Interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially, at school, or in a job`,`Inattention
      People with symptoms of inattention may often:
      
      Overlook or miss details and make seemingly careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or during other activities
      Have difficulty sustaining attention during play or tasks, such as conversations, lectures, or lengthy reading
      Not seem to listen when spoken to directly
      Find it hard to follow through on instructions or finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace, or may start tasks but lose focus and get easily sidetracked
      Have difficulty organizing tasks and activities, doing tasks in sequence, keeping materials and belongings in order, managing time, and meeting deadlines
      Avoid tasks that require sustained mental effort, such as homework, or for teens and older adults, preparing reports, completing forms, or reviewing lengthy papers
      Lose things necessary for tasks or activities, such as school supplies, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys, paperwork, eyeglasses, and cell phones
      Be easily distracted by unrelated thoughts or stimuli
      Be forgetful in daily activities, such as chores, errands, returning calls, and keeping appointments`],

      paragrafs:[`Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition that affects people's behaviour. People with ADHD can seem restless, may have trouble concentrating and may act on impulse.

      Symptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age and may become more noticeable when a child's circumstances change, such as when they start school.
      
      Most cases are diagnosed when children are under 12 years old, but sometimes it's diagnosed later in childhood.
      
      Sometimes ADHD was not recognised when someone was a child, and they are diagnosed later as an adult.
      
      The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who were diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems.
      
      People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders.`,`Getting help
        Many children go through phases where they're restless or inattentive. This is often completely normal and does not necessarily mean they have ADHD.

        But you should discuss your concerns with your child's teacher, their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or a GP if you think their behaviour may be different from most children their age.

        It's also a good idea to speak to a GP if you're an adult and think you may have ADHD, but were not diagnosed with the condition as a child.`,`What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?
        The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but the condition has been shown to run in families.

        Research has also identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD when compared with those without the condition.

        Other factors suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include:

        being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy)
        having a low birthweight
        smoking or alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy
